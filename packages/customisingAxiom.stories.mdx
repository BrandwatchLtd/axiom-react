# Customising Axiom

Axiom aims to cover the vast majority of use cases but inevitably there will be times when you need to implement a behaviour or style that Axiom does not support. 
When this occurs you have a few options, we would ask before considering these options you reach out to us so we can consider updating Axiom to support more use cases.

<br /> 

## Custom CSS classNames
Nearly all components now support custom ClassNames being passed, please raise a PR or issue if you find one that does not. 
These classnames will then be rendered in the final DOM output e.g

```
<Table className="my-nice-class"/>
```

Some components render multiple children in this case we will provide a custom prop to describe the element you want to target.

```
  <TextInput className="my-custom-class" inputClassName="my-input-class"/>

  <Base className={className}>
    <TextInput className={inputClassName} />
  </Base>
```

## Using Axiom CSS Variables
This feature is not yet fully documented however `@brandwatch/axiom-materials` defines utility CSS variables which can be used to compose your own components 
or add spacing or other styles that are consistent with the Axiom designs.

One common use case is to apply color or spacing e.g.

```
// app.css

.box {
  padding: var(--spacing-grid-size--x2);
  background: var(--color-theme-background--shade-2);
}

```

Exported CSS variables can be found [here](https://github.com/BrandwatchLtd/axiom-react/blob/master/packages/axiom-materials/src/importCssVariables.js)

You can also use this [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/axiom-materials-import-importcssvariables-9mwhi) as an example template.
