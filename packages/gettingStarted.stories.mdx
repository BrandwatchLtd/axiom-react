# Getting Started

Axiom is made up of mutiple packages but you'll just need axiom-components to get started.

```
npm i @brandwatch/axiom-components
```

```
import { Button } from '@brandwatch/axiom-components';
```

You can now use the button component - To see how this can be styled and configured see [Button](/?path=/docs/button--example)

```
<Button variant="primary">
  Primary
</Button>
```

If you want to get started even quicker you can try out Axiom in this [Codesandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/axiom-template-p9r9ox564q?file=/src/index.js)
