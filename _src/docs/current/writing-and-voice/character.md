# We are curious, questioning and challenging of everything

This approach to knowledge applies to novel trends as well as conventional wisdom. Everything becomes an invitation to absorb new information.


# We are transparent and honest to the core

There’s nothing we’re trying to hide and we’re not afraid to be frank about the truth.


# We are knowledgeable and reliable

It makes us inherently authoritative and it means that we know what we are talking about. We’re comfortable speaking about the ideas behind copy we publish. We know why we wrote them and are confident in our answers when confronted with alternatives.


# We are witty, but not hilarious

We seek knowing smiles, not raucous laughter.


# We are positive, but not excitable

Our audience feels upbeat, not fanatical.


# We are conversational, but not colloquial

Copy is delivered like speech, but without slang.


# We don’t rock, we’re not awesome and we’re certainly not gurus

There’s a deep level of sophistication in what we write and it commands a level of respect and intrigue that becomes lost when the language doesn’t mirror that ethos.
