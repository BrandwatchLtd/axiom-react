# Emphasize important words in short help texts

Make **important** words in help texts **bold** so users can skim through them more easily. You can use the utility classes for this. Try to highlight the words that embody the message best.


# Full stops

We have a simple policy. If it is a sentence, it has full stop. Titles, incomplete sentences, bullet lists or enumerations don't have a full stop.


# Casing Conventions

Title Casing - not only the first word is capitalized but all (except ‘small’ words like “and”, “to”, “for” or “the”). e.g.: “**C**reate **N**ew **P**roject”.

Title Casing should be used in:

* Utility bar / window titles
* Menu entries
* Tab titles
* HTML header title
* Main navigation links
* Buttons

Sentence casing - just like a sentence: first word capitalized. e.g.: “**G**et an email when there's a sudden increase in discussion[...]”.

Sentence casing should be used for:

* Placeholder text in input fields
* Form labels (next to or above text inputs, check boxes etc.)
* ‘activity’ links, e.g. “Create one”, “Collapse list”
* Messages of all sorts (“Please wait…” or longer stuff)
* Entries in (filter) drop downs
* Help texts
