This is a documentation experiment using te library [react-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/).

## Pros
- Easy to set up an configure using `styleguide.config.js` to identify locations of components and documentation
- A lot of good documentation generation out of the box. Props are generated automatically and example code sandboxes are provided for free.
- Has a cool way to link to a specific component like this http://localhost:6060/#!/Button
## Cons
- Not hugely flexible in where to put documentation. A tabbed system would be pleasant
- Not the easiest thing to style as you need to use react dev tools to find a particular element, then edit that in the styleguide config
- The docs are autogenerated into one page unless you explicitly specify sections. More config writing than we would like.
