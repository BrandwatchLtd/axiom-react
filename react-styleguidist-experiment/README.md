This is a documentation playground built using [React styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/).

## Usage

### Starting the dev server
```shell
$ npx styleguidist server
```

### Adding documentation
The documentation can live alongside the components here in `md` files.

These `md` files can make use of the components themselves and have a nice ammount of boilerplate tagged on for free such as prop listing and a code playground.

We can also have a general purpose docs section that can be pointed to through the frameworks config file. All config sits in the `styleguide.config.js` file and documentation for this can be found [here](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/configuration.html).
