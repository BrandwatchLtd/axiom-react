This is a documentation playground built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Usage

### Starting the dev server
```
$ yarn storybook
```

### Adding documentation
The 'documentation' is built using things called stories that can live anywhere, but here are stored next to the component in a `story.js` file. A basic guide on how to set up a story can be found [here](https://www.learnstorybook.com/react/en/simple-component/);

It is possible to add a `md` file to a story using the [notes addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/notes) and the [info addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/info) seems specific to building styleguides as well.
